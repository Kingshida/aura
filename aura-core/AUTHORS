This project derives its earliest roots from the MNAV code written by:

  Jung Soon Jang <jjang@xbow.com>

Subsequently almost everything has been changed and rewritten.  Many code
modules have been forked/imported from FlightGear/SimGear including the
property system, xml support, core autopilot code, much of the math and
utility functions.
