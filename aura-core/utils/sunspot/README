This code requires the SimGear library (from the FlightGear.org
project) to build.  SimGear provides "ephemeris" computational
routines.  This allows us to compute a NED vector to the sun (for
example) or negate that vector to look at our shadow.

Because of the simgear dependency, this code is not included in the
automated build system.

Here is an example command to build the code directly:

g++ -o shadowpoint -I/usr/local/FlightGear-2.6/include -L /usr/local/FlightGear-2.6/lib64 shadowpoint.cxx -lsgmath -lsgtiming -lsgephem -lsgstructure -lsgdebug -lsgmisc -lplibnet -lplibul -lm

g++ -o test-pan-tilt -I/usr/local/FlightGear-3.2/include -L /usr/local/FlightGear-3.2/lib64 test-pan-tilt.cxx -lgps -lSimGearCore -lplibnet -lplibul -lm -lpthread

Then you will need to start gpsd manually before you run the code using 
something like:

    gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0

You can run gpsmon in a separate window to directly observe the gps output
